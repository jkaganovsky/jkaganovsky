# Jailanie Kaganovsky's Portfolio
## Description
Here you will find my current portfolio as a web developer using REACT. All of which will contain past, current, and future projects that I have built and are cotinuously being updated and improved since I started UW Coding Bootcamp in September 2020.

This project will serve as the Portfolio I will be using for future job prospects, which will continuosly be edited, updated, and improved on as I continue to build on my coding skills throughout this program.
